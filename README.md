# Is-your-birthday-lucky

I have made this webapp to show the user is user birthday is lucky or not

used input type="date" to take date of birth and input type"number " to take lucky number

then used removeall function in continous loop to remove "-" from date of birth

then sum the integers of date of birth and used condition operater to show the output if the the condition is match(sum=luckynumber)
